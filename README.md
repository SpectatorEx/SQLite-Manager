# SQLite manager.

A simple **SQLite manager** for processing SQL queries in the **Windows** terminal.\
It has a graphical interface that makes it easier to connect to the database and create queries.

It can be used both for educational purposes and for the development of a specific project.
Perhaps in the future the manager will need many more improvements, but now there is all the necessary functionality.

## Features
* Creating and opening databases.
* Displaying SQL queries on the console screen using SELECT.

## How to use

First you need to open an existing database or create a new one. 
The created database should be stored in the "*database*" folder. When creating it, you must enter the full name of the file, including its extension.

For example: *users.db*.

Similarly with SQL queries, enter the full name of the file (including subdirectories) with the .sql extension.\
All queries are stored in the "queries" folder. For convenience, you can create subdirectories with the database name\
and execute queries from there.

For example: *table.sql* or *users/table.sql*.
